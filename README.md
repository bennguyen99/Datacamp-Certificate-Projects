# Datacamp-Certificate-Projects

## Introduction
This repository contains all 3 projects I did in obtaining the DataCamp certificates, including SQL Associate, Associate Data Analyst, and Professional Data Analyst.

For associate certificates, I finished one written report in the Datacamp workspace (also available in jupyter notebook format here); for professional certificates, I finished an oral report with Powerpoint after data analysis.

Readers can refer to this repository to gain an insight of Datacamp certificates, but directly using my answer to the same project is prohibitted!

## Ability required
Multiple abilities are tested in the four certificates (projects).

For theoretical knowledge, please refer to https://app.datacamp.com/certification/resource-center/requirements.

For practical projects, following abilities are tested:

  - **Data Validation**: Assess data quality and perform validation tasks.
  - **Data Cleaning**: Deal with duplicates, outliers, null values, and wrong-formatted data.
  - **EDA**: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to explore key insights that drive actionable decisions.
  - **Data Visualization**: Create data visualizations in coding language to demonstrate the characteristics of data and represent relationships between features.
  - **Business Focus**: Make recommendations for analytic approaches based on business goals.
  - **Business Metrics**: Judge performance of analytic results against relevant business criteria.
  - **Communication**: Employs multiple tactics (written and verbal) to communicate with business leaders.

There is one pdf file in each of the project folders where a more specific description of these tested abilities can be found.

## Tools used

Mutiple tools are used in the three projects as follows.

  - _**PostgreSQL**_ for data cleaning and analysis.

  - _**Numpy**_ for numerical computation.

  - _**Pandas**_ for processing csv files and visualization.

  - _**Matplotlib**_ and Seaborn for better and more complicated visualization.
